# gameLib
a small game library made in c. Console app.

Description

This project is a console-based C application created as a final project. 
It demonstrates structured C programming techniques to build a basic game system using low-level constructs like functions, structs, and manual memory handling. 
The goal was to explore clean, modular game architecture in pure C.

Features

- Organized procedural code in a single `.c` file
- Game loop and logic handling
- Input handling via standard input
- Console output for interaction
- Lightweight and portable â€” compiles on any platform with a C compiler
